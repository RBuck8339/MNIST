# MNIST
Repository for me to learn Computer Vision basics using MNIST Dataset

# Digits Dataset: 
  # To Do: 
      - Test regularization techniques
      - Try to get closer to a 1.0 accuracy

# Fashion Dataset:
  - Current Accuracy: 0.9106
  - Current Loss: 0.2882
  
  # Techniques Tested & Applied:
      - Data Augmentation
      - Regularization
      - Different activation functions (specifically 'relu' and 'leaky_relu')
      - Dropout
      - Different optimizers
      
  # To Do: 
      - Come back when more knowledgable about computer vision topics
